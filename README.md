# Automated Testing Setup

This repository has been automatically configured with GitHub Actions for continuous testing.

## Setup Instructions

## Setting up GitHub Actions for KHarish15/testing6

This project utilizes HTML and Playwright for testing a login form.  Since there are no external dependencies, the setup is streamlined.

**1. Adding the Workflow File**

Create a file named `.github/workflows/test.yml` in your repository.  This file will define the workflow for your tests.

```yaml
name: Playwright Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Or your default branch

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Playwright
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16  # Or a supported Node version

      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npm install playwright --force
        # Note: This is important for consistency on the action.
        # If no explicit package manager, Playwright is installed manually
        # and the npm install is needed.

      - name: Run Playwright Tests
        run: |
          npx playwright test --project=chromium #Run tests for Chrome.  Replace with firefox/webkit as needed for cross-browser testing.

      - name: Upload Test Report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report # Update if generated differently
```


**2. Environment Variables**

No environment variables are needed for this project.


**3. Dependencies**

Playwright is the only dependency, and is installed using the `npm install playwright --force` command within the workflow.  


**4. Configuring Playwright**

Playwright is a Javascript testing framework. The test workflow installs it directly in the actions.  No other configuration is required within this workflow file for the HTML project.



**5. Viewing Test Results**

After a successful run, the test results are generated and placed in the `playwright-report` artifact.  To view them:

* Navigate to the Actions tab in your GitHub repository.
* Find the workflow run corresponding to the successful test.
* Click on the "Artifacts" tab for the successful run.
* Download the `playwright-report` artifact to review the test results.  These results will contain success/failure statuses and detailed output.


**6. Troubleshooting**

* **Error: `npm install` not recognized:** Ensure Node.js and npm are correctly installed on your build machine (the Actions runner).
* **Playwright installation failure:**  Double-check the `npm install playwright --force` command. If installation fails, try using the newest Node version.


**7. Project-Specific Configuration**

* **Local Testing Setup (HTML):**
    * Use a local web server like `http-server` or `live-server` to test your HTML locally.
    * For example, with `http-server`: `npm install -g http-server && http-server`
    * Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to view your login page.
* **Playwright for Browser Testing:**
    * Install Playwright globally (if not already in the workflow).
* **HTML Validation:**
    * Use a validation tool online (e.g., validator.nu) to ensure your HTML code conforms to standards, avoiding errors or unexpected behavior in different browsers.
* **Cross-Browser Testing:**
    * Playwright allows testing different browsers directly within the Actions run. Add the proper project parameters to test different browsers: `npx playwright test --project=chromium,firefox,webkit`.  You will see results for each of these browsers, which will allow you to see if there are any cross-browser compatibility issues.




**Important Note:** This setup assumes the tests are simple, but are in the `.html` file. If there are complexities in your tests or your application, you should ensure to include any associated Javascript or testing scripts. If these scripts are significant, they might need to be structured and handled accordingly, using Node packages.


This detailed, step-by-step guide provides a more targeted solution specifically for the HTML project with minimal external dependencies. Remember to replace placeholders with your actual file paths or settings, and adapt to any project-specific complexities that may arise. Remember that you are free to use other local tooling in a project file or via npm dependencies outside the GitHub actions workflow if they are needed for your Javascript.
