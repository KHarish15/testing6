# Automated Testing Setup

This repository has been automatically configured with GitHub Actions for continuous testing.

## Setup Instructions

## Integrating GitHub Actions with KHarish15/testing6

This document outlines the setup instructions for integrating GitHub Actions with the Python project `KHarish15/testing6`.

**1. Adding the Workflow File:**

Create a file named `.github/workflows/test.yml` in the repository root directory.  This assumes your Python files (`main.py`, `test_main.py`) are at the top level of the repository.

```yaml
name: Python Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.9' # Or your desired Python version
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install pytest
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
```

**2. Environment Variables (None needed for this project)**

No environment variables are required for this simple project.

**3. Dependencies:**

The project needs `pytest` for testing.

**4. Configuring the Test Framework (pytest):**

The provided test code utilizes `pytest` which is now installed automatically by the workflow.  Ensure `test_main.py` exists (see code example below).

**5. Viewing Test Results:**

The GitHub Actions workflow will output the test results directly within the Actions section of the repository.  Success or failure will be clearly indicated.  Detailed test results will be shown if they occur, including failing assertions.


**6. Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

* **`pip` issues:** Verify your `pip` installation is correct during the `Install dependencies` step.  If you encounter errors during this step, try `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip` followed by your package installation command.

* **`pytest` errors:** Double-check that your test files (`test_main.py`) are in the correct location (same directory as `main.py` or in a subdirectory) and that the imports are correct (`from main import ...`).

* **Python version conflicts:** Verify the `python-version` in the `actions/setup-python` step matches the Python version your project requires.

* **Network issues:** Ensure your repository has internet access during the workflow run.

**7. Project-Specific Configuration Steps (None needed in this case)**

This project is straightforward and does not require specific configuration.

**Example `main.py`:**

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a / b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

def is_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0

def get_max(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Empty list provided")
    return max(numbers)
```

**Example `test_main.py`:**


```python
import pytest
from main import add, subtract, divide, multiply, is_even, get_max

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0

def test_subtract():
    assert subtract(10, 5) == 5
    assert subtract(5, 10) == -5
```

This complete example covers a basic project with tests. Ensure that `test_main.py` accurately tests the functionalities within `main.py`.  Add more test cases as needed.  Remember to commit your `.github/workflows/test.yml` file to your repository.




**Important Considerations for HTML projects (not applicable here):**

This project is Python, so these sections do not apply.  If you had HTML files, these steps would be necessary:

* **Local Server:**  Use a simple web server like `python -m http.server` to serve the HTML files.
* **Playwright:**  For browser testing, install Playwright using `pip install playwright`.
* **HTML Validation:** Use tools like the W3C validator to ensure your HTML conforms to standards.
* **Cross-browser Testing:** Consider using tools like BrowserStack or Sauce Labs for automated cross-browser testing if you need to test in various browsers and environments.


This enhanced response now includes proper file structure guidance and a more detailed troubleshooting section, addressing specific project needs. Remember to tailor the `python-version` and tests to match your project.

## Generated Files

- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- `tests/` - Test files
- This README - Setup instructions

## How to Use

1. Push code to trigger automated tests
2. View results in the Actions tab
3. Tests run on every push and pull request

## Token Information

- Generated by: KHarish15
- Repository: KHarish15/testing6
- Generated on: 2025-08-01 05:38:02

## Security Note

The GitHub token used for this setup should have the minimum required permissions:
- `repo` scope for private repositories
- `public_repo` scope for public repositories
- Write access to the repository

For security, consider using GitHub Apps or fine-grained personal access tokens.
